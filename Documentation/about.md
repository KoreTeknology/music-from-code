# Notes about Sonic Pi

**Sonic Pi** is a free software, created by *Sam Aaron*. it was first intended to teach programming language at school and to give to any musicians the endless possibilities of coding your own setup, sequences and songs. You can read about **Sonic Pi** on its website, Github pages and other supports available on line. 

By the time that i get myself into live coding, i download and try vraious softwares, live-coding related, but this one is my favorite, easy to go, minimal GUI, a large palette of included synth, a good sampler and a strategic concept of creating lines or chords and scales. If you have somemusical background, you will recognize at start the classic notation system as well as the logic.
