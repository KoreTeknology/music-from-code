# Notes about Sonic Pi

**Sonic Pi** is a free software, created by *Sam Aaron*. it was first intended to teach programming language at school and to give to any musicians the endless possibilities of coding your own setup, sequences and songs. You can read about **Sonic Pi** on its website, Github pages and other supports available on line. 

By the time that i get myself into live coding, i download and try vraious softwares, live-coding related, but this one is my favorite, easy to go, minimal GUI, a large palette of included synth, a good sampler and a strategic concept of creating lines or chords and scales. If you have somemusical background, you will recognize at start the classic notation system as well as the logic.

From his creator´s perspective (Sam Aaron), this is how and why it was made:

---

> **Sonic Pi is a new kind of musical instrument. Instead of strumming strings or whacking things with sticks - you write code - live.
Sonic Pi has been designed with the aim to find a harmonious balance between three core principles:**

>**Simple enough for the 10 year old within you
Joyful enough for you to lose yourself through play
Powerful enough for your own expressions
Sonic Pi is a complete open source programming environment originally designed to explore and teach programming concepts within schools through the process of creating new sounds.**

>**In addition to being an engaging education resource it has evolved into an extremely powerful and performance-ready live coding instrument suitable for professional artists and DJs.**

>**Whilst Education is a core focus it now sits at the intersection between three core domains:**

>**Art - providing the means to express yourself and ask new questions of music and notation<br>
Technology - exploring questions related to liveness, time and concurrency in programming languages<br>
Education - demonstrating that open play rather than rigid structures increases motivation and engagement in the classroom<br>
Again, finding a balance working to the best benefits of all these domains is the objective.**<br>

So, this is a very strong project with educational purpose in mind :) and this is what i offer to learn here, following my methodology and research. Enjoy and don´t forget to send me some feedback or questions, regarding this documention and the demo projects.
