# Audio Recording

Using **sonic Pi**, we will have to use *audio files*, we will record and play those files in a way to share or publish our creations. Also, we will make a difference between the *working files* and the *audio master file*. Don´t worry, those principles are very easy to understand and the concept of recording is pretty **conventional**. What ever you are in a recording studio, or in your bedroom, you are using your *computer interface or audio sound card* the same way. The sound that comes in and comes out of your computer are recorded as a digitilized signals to be played by audio samplers or any audio players.

## Files formats

We have to distinguish 2 main types of files during our process of **creating music**. The first type is a *"ruby" file*, an archive that includes code and can be read by **Sonic Pi**. These files are really important as it keeps the original design of your music, we call them *"working files"* and their extension is .rb. Also we have *audio files*, generaly with the .wav extension. This last type of file is a music content, the audio signal recorded at specific frequencies (44100, 48000, 96000...) wich gives its definition. Let´s see in details those file formats and how to produce them.
