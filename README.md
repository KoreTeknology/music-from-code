[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)
The aim of this project is to learn, experiment and produce music from code. Simple as writing lines of commands and definitions for producing sounds and sequences? How ? **Using the excellent and educational tool [Sonic Pi Software](https://sonic-pi.net/) created by Sam Aaron!** This is a good oportunity to enter the world of live-coding and music production at the same time. Also, this tool was made with "Open Hardware" compatibility in mind, as it is intended to run on Raspberry Pi boards (i didnÂ´t try yet), Windows, Apple and Linux OS.

There are several tools available to create sound using programming, but my attention was catched by the Sonic Pi, very intuitive ground, easy to teach and nice for sharing a lot of fun with friends! So after i started producing music with it, i also started to get a lot of notes about the language, the techniques and api documentation! This is why this page exists.

## CUSTOM SYNTHETIZERS MADE WITH SUPERCOLLIDER

We can create new synth in a shape of synthdefs from supercollider, we will lokk at how to build them and how to use them in sonic Pi.
Here is [**Temporary documentation**](Custom%20Synths/test%20synths/customsynths.md)

None at the moment

## :sparkling_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can use this service for free.
However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it :-

- Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it :D
- Starring and sharing the project :rocket:

Thanks! :heart:
