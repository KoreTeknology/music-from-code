[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)
The aim of this project is to experiment and produce music from code. How ? Using the excellent [**Sonic Pi Software**](https://sonic-pi.net/)! There are several tools available to create sound using programming, but my attention was catched by the Sonic Pi, very intuitive ground, easy to teach and nice for sharing a lot of fun! So after i started producing music with it, i also started to get a lot of notes about the language, the techniques and api documentation! This is why this page exists.
